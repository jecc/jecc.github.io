**1. Get Kodi**

Download from kodi.tv/download.

**2. Get comfortable with Kodi.**

There are many tutorials and guides on the web. Here's a good one that I found:

There is a complete keyboard reference available at http://kodi.wiki/view/Keyboard_controls

Be sure to install some of the officially sanctioned Kodi add-ons. I really like the Radio add-on for Internet radio stations.

**3. Get a few extra-curricular addons.**

Here are some video listers to get started:

Stream All the Sources (SALTS)

Phoenix

 these guys are kinda wacky "bad boyz", but they have some good stuff.

Exodus

(read the note at the top of the article)

There are all kinds of music add-ons too.
